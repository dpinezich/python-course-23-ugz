# Get Ready Workshop - Homework

To learn a bit more, I have prepared some Exercises / Doings for you to do after the course. 
There are no given solutions here, rather you should think about a good solution and send it to david.pinezich@apigenio.ch.
I will then comment your solution and give you feedback.

Of course if you are stuck, we can have an email conversation or a quick call.

## Homework 1 

Let us have a small flashback onto basic geometry: http://members.chello.at/gut.jutta.gerhard/formeln/formeln3d.htm

Select one or two of these examples (for example: cube).
Decide which variables you need, and ask the user about them.
For a cube it is only a.

Your program should then proceed and give the surface, volume and additional information according to the picture.

Optional (covered in Basic Course):

Have a look at https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
Let the user decide, which figure he or she wants.

## Homework 2

A simple body-mass index calculator. This program should ask the user about his/her weight and height.
Given this information it should calculate weight / height^2 and give out the value.

Optional (covered in Basic Course):

Have a look at this image: ![BMI](https://www.usz.ch/app/uploads/2022/04/usz-grafik-bmi-gruppen-480x254.png)
and https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp

Depending on the result of the user, tell him or her in which group he or she is.
Note: we have not yet covered if and else, but it is a great learning to do it in an exploratory way.

## Homework 3

Who will be millionaire?

Think about 5 questions (more are not needed).
Create a program, which asks the user this 5 questions one after another.
There is no right or wrong in the basic version of this, rather it should entertain the user.

Optional (covered in Basic Course):

Have a look at https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
Now you can decide if the input was correct or not.
Please give the user CHF 1000.- for each correct answer and output the amount at the end.
